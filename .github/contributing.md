**1.** Code is not to be submitted to the `master` or `development` branch directly  
**2.** New features are to be submitted using a `feature` branch attached to `development`  
**3.** Quick fixes must be submitted using a `fix` branch attached to `dev`  
**4.** Only branches that pass CI will be merged  
**5.** Feature and commit names must be clear  
**6.** Always pull before you push  
**7.** If you get a merge conflict, consult the person whose code is in conflict with yours  
**8.** All pull requests are to be accepted only by approved persons  
**9.** <u>If you are ever confused ask for help, don't just hope you use the right git command</u>
